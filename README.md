# LightPy
Rewrite of my older python light renderer, to be faster and better organised.

# Required Libs:

    "numpy"
    "pygame"










# Current Features:
    Light rendering, supporting up to 50 lights, not as fast as i would like it to be currently, soon to be threaded
  
    Wall Obstruction, Placable Walls that block light rays accurately.
  
    Neat and tidy code, mostly commented
  
# WIP Features:
    Threading, or well mostly multiprocessing
  
    Replacing most math with numpy
  
    Colored Lights
  
    Bigger Resoulution Support
  
  
Thats all i got for now.
if you want to look, the old LightPy script is included, **be warned, it is _not_ a pretty sight**

Special Thanks to you for reading :)
